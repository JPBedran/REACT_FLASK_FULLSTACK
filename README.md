# New Year Project


A PWA Full project using Router. Developing with Redux, Hooks, Redux-Saga, Context-API and GraphQL to test and check out all different state managers. JEST for testing.

-- Still thinking in checking out Firebase Backend solution, or building my own. Checking out Firebase makes me consider building my own more.
