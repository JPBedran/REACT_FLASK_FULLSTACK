# Fullstack React


A PWA Full project using Router. Developing with Redux, Hooks, Redux-Saga, Context-API and GraphQL to test and check out all different state managers. JEST for testing.

SASS for styling! no reactstrap, building UX from scratch. Thinking of mixing in Three.js for some 3d user experience (dont know where that would fit in an ecommerce.

-- Still thinking in checking out Firebase Backend solution, or building my own. Checking out Firebase makes me consider building my own more.

 Decided to build backend in Flask. Interesting microframework, great to work as an REST API. So im going to try it out.
